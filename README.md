Open .xcodeproj using Xcode -> Run

To change to correct working directory:

Product -> Scheme -> Edit Scheme -> Working Directory -> check "use custom working directory" -> type in $PROJECT_DIR/$PROJECT_NAME

NOTE: store all "ready to pass in" files in the same path with main.cpp file.

# User Manual(makefile)

makefile tested on MacOS 10.9.5

Put all files(sources and makefile) in the same directory, navigate to that directory from the Terminal, and type 'make'. This will create a program called 'main'.
